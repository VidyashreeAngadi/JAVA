Print GFG n times without the loop.
Example:
Input:
5
Output:
GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printGfg() that takes N as parameter and prints N times GFG recursively.
Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

class Solution {
    void printGfg(int N) {
        // code here
      for(int i=1;i<=N;i++)
      {
          System.out.print("GFG"+" ");
      }
    }
}
