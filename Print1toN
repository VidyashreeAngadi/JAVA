Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes n as a parameter and prints the number from 1 to n recursively.
Note: Don't print any newline, it will be added by the driver code.
Examples:
Input: n = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Input: n = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Input: n = 1
Output: 1

class Solution
{
  public void printNos(int N)
    {
        //Your code here
        for(int i=1;i<=N;i++)
        System.out.print(i+" ");
    }
}
