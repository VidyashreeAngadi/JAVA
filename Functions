Geek is learning about functions and calling a function with arguments. He learns that passing can take one of two forms: pass by value or pass by reference.
Geek wishes to add 1 and 2, respectively, to the parameter passed by value and reference. Help Geek in fulfilling his goal.
Example 1:
Input:
a = 1
b = 2
Output:
2 4
Explanation: 1 was passed by value whereas 2 passed by reference.
Example 2:
Input:
a = 10
b = 20
Output: 11 22
Explanation: 10 was passed by value whereas 20 passed by reference.

class Solution {
    static int[] passedBy(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        a++;
        b+=2;
        return new int[]{a,b};
    }
}
