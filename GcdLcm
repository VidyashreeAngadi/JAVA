Given two integers a and b, Your task is to return a list containing their LCM and GCD.
Examples:
Input: a = 5 , b = 10
Output: [10, 5]
Explanation: LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5.
Input: a = 14 , b = 8
Output: [56, 2]
Explanation: LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2.
Input: a = 1 , b = 1
Output: [1, 1]
Explanation: LCM of 1 and 1 is 1, while their GCD is 1.

class Solution {
    static Long[] lcmAndGcd(Long A , Long B) {
        // code here
        while(A%B!=0)
        {
            long rem=A%B;
            A=B;
            B=rem;
        }
        long gcd=B;
        long lcm=(A*B)/gcd;
    }
}
