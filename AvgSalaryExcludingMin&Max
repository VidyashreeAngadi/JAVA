You are given an array of unique integers salary where salary[i] is the salary of the ith employee.
Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
Example 1:
Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]
Output: 2500.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000) / 2 = 2500
Example 2:
Input: salary = [1000,2000,3000]
Output: 2000.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 3000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000) / 1 = 2000

class Solution {
    public double average(int[] salary) {
        int min=salary[0];
        int max=salary[0];
        int sum=salary[0];
        for(int i=1;i<salary.length;i++)
        {
            if(max<salary[i])
            {
                max=salary[i];
            }
            else if(min>salary[i])
            {
                min=salary[i];
            }
            sum=sum+salary[i];
        }
            sum=sum-min-max;
            double ans=(double)sum/(salary.length-2);
        return ans;
    }
}
